# Mr Miyagi project
## Ask for user input and depending on the response, mr Miyagi will respond.
## Objectives:
- prompt user for input
- Evaluate each input and print the appropriate responses
- Follow these rules:
    - every time you ask a question --> Mr. Miyagi responds with
        - 'questions are wise, but for now. Wax on, and Wax off!'
    - every statement/question must start with Sensei, otherwise:
        - 'You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei please'
    - every time you mention 'block' or 'blocking' --> Mr. Miyagi responds with
        - 'Remember, best block, not to be there..'
    - anything else you say:
        - 'do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off.'
    - Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'Sensei, I am at peace'
        - 'Sometimes, what heart know, head forget'
